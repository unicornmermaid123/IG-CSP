# List steps in an algorithm
    #1 pieces of info needed
    #2 process info
    #3 provide output

# List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
# (/) divide
# (*) multiply
# (+) add
# (-) subtract
# (**) Exponets
# (//) integer divsion
# (%) modulo(remainder)

# Why are expressions so important in programming?
# cuase everything is math
# if you set it up once you never have to do it again
